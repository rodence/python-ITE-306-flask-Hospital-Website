            HMIT Medical Center is recognized as the leading and most respected healthcare institution in the Philippines. Its two facilities in Quezon City and Global City, Taguig are at par with the most advanced hospitals around the world. A testament to St. Luke's world class quality medical service is its accreditation with, and affiliation to, prestigious international organizations.
St. Luke’s - Quezon City has the sole distinction of being the ﬁrst hospital in the country accredited by the JCI, or Joint Commission International: the international arm of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)—the oldest and most prestigious healthcare accreditation organization in the world—which the facility received in 2003.
